This is an educational website teaching you how to handle multiple administrative tasks without being overwhelmed


The website is a simple prototype meant to be developed further. My friend created a system of how to put order into administrative tasks and did not know how to present it to people. After discussing the matter with him, we agreed that I will make for him the first prototype for him to see how such educational website could look like and now there is his turn to add his content in the form of simple explanation and exercises done in similar way as the temporary exercises I used for the lessons 1 and 2. In the future the free website can be turned into a paid version where the study and use of its content could be monetised.
